Using XAMPP to run the .php files, ensure photoviewer.html and photoChanger.php are both within the xampp directory of:

C:\xampp\htdocs\CS

create the .\cs directory if need be.

create an images file within the directory of .\cs, you don't need to put anything in there.

Assuming you have all the files from me, you simply need to put them into the CS folder of the xampp directory,
and the program will run perfectly.

In Internet Explorer, enter the URL:
http://localhost:5500/CS/photoviewer.html

The port is 5500 as altered in the XAMPP directory.
Run the xampp-control application, navigate to the Apache config. and change the port.

You can now scroll through the pictures freely, add comments & come back to see them later, as they will be there without any sort of 
expiration date.

The blank text files that contain the comments have been provided, though are created automatically upon running the program regardless.
The program works with any number of images or comments, despite their name or anything else.
